# AmesHousing
The goal of this project is to create a model that will use the distinct features of homes to predict the Sales Price of a given house.  This type of model could be used in a variety of business settings including by real estate agents who wanted a tool to advise clients or by institutional investors who were looking to purchase  properties or by lenders who want to ensure the purchase price of the mortgages they are underwriting are reasonable.  Although the dataset is unique to a specific location, this type of analysis could be performed for residential and commercial properties in any location where information from past sales is available.
